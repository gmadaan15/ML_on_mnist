# ML_on_mnist
This project/notebook implements from very basic ML algorithms to advanced neural nets. Its is also a mix of two out of the five projects that I did in the EDX MIT MOOC( link text). Most of the helper functions and the basic structure were given in the base project. The idea behind converting this to a notebook was to make it more organised, readable and runnable off the shelf, and to add the support of gpus so that the neural net based models work faster. In addition to trying on the Mnist digit dataset, we also tried the neural net based models on an extra fashion based dataset for binary classification. This explores the nn's performance when augmentations are done and when augmentations are not done.
